# Hi, I’m Maximilian Mauroner

I build software people actually use—whether it’s a festival ordering system or a simple mood tracker to keep my own head straight. By day I’m a Software Engineering student; by night you’ll find me hacking away on side projects or drafting my next blog post.

## What I’m Working On

- Shipping features in Next.js and React Native  
- Juggling lectures, part-time work, and whatever side project sparks joy  
- Turning my Qwik experiments (and their dead ends) into blog stories

## My Toolkit

- Frontend: React, Next.js (and a bit of Svelte when I’m feeling adventurous)  
- Mobile: React Native  
- Backend: PHP or plain C (I gave Rust a spin, but I missed the low-level fun)  
- CI/CD pipelines—because manual deploys are the worst

## Favorite Projects

- **Festival Ordering System**  
  Streamlined food & drink orders at events big and small.  
- **Mood Tracker App**  
  A lightweight daily check-in that surprisingly stuck.  
- **TeddyDocs BZ**  
  A pediatric initiative’s new website.  
- **ÖERD**  
  A work-in-progress site for an Austrian society.

## What’s Next

- Dive deeper into systems programming with C  
- Revisit Svelte once Runes feels less experimental  
- Finally finish one of my 100+ half-baked ideas (no pressure 😉)
