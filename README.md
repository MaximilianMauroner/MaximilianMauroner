Hi, I’m Maximilian.

I build software to fix things that bug me, improve workflows, and make everyday tech a bit nicer.  
Mostly TypeScript and React with Next.js and React Native/Expo. If something else feels right, I try that too.

I build client and internal stuff at Lab4Code, including **[TeddyDocs BZ](https://www.teddydocs-bz.org/)**.

Some side projects I’ve kept going:
- **[hide-sensitive-information](https://github.com/MaximilianMauroner/hide-sensitive-information)**
- **[claude-code-notify](https://github.com/MaximilianMauroner/claude-code-notify)**
- **[Moodinator](https://github.com/MaximilianMauroner/Moodinator)**
- **[how-long-to-api](https://github.com/MaximilianMauroner/how-long-to-api)**

I also write:
- quick notes and experiments - [snacks](https://www.mauroner.net/snacks)
- longer, diary-style dev logs - [dev log](https://www.mauroner.net/dev-log)
- general posts - [blog](https://www.mauroner.net/blog)

Everything else (work, contact, links) lives here:
