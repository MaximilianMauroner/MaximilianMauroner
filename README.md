Hi, I’m Maximilian 👋

I build small, practical software to improve everyday workflows — tools and apps I actually use.

Most of my work lives in the TypeScript + React ecosystem (Next.js, React Native/Expo), with occasional experiments when curiosity wins.

I build client and internal projects at **Lab4Code**, including **TeddyDocs BZ** → [teddydocs-bz.org](https://www.teddydocs-bz.org/), and maintain a growing collection of side projects like **hide-sensitive-information**, **claude-code-notify**, **Moodinator**, and **how-long-to-api**.

I also write:
- quick notes & experiments → [/snacks](https://www.mauroner.net/snacks)
- longer, diary-style dev logs → [/dev-log](https://www.mauroner.net/dev-log)
- general blog posts → [/blog](https://www.mauroner.net/blog)

Everything — work, writing, and contact info — lives here:
